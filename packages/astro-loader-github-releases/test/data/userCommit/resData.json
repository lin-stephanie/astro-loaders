I've now added an `htmlTagNames` option in https://github.com/lin-stephanie/rehype-callouts/commit/0c789f4ec500a1199c0ca8099831be8f60ebed70 to allow more flexible HTML tag naming. \r\n\r\nFor collapsible callouts, though, the `details` and `summary` tags are functionally required, but I think using `collapsibleContentTagName` could achieve a similar semantic effect. What do you think of this approach?",
